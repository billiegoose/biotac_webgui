biotac_webgui
=============

A webpage visualization of the Biotac finger data from ROS using rosbridge.

To run, follow the instructions on the [basic Rosbridge tutorial]
(http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs/Tutorials/BasicRosFunctionality#Running_the_Example)
but for ROS Fuerte keep in mind that the launcher for the rosbridge websocket server is
```roslaunch rosbridge_launch simple.launch```
instead of whatever the tutorial says.
